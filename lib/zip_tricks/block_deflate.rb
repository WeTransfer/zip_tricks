require 'zlib'

# Permits Deflate compression in independent blocks. The workflow is as follows:
#
# * Run every block to compress through deflate_chunk, remove the header,
#   footer and adler32 from the result
# * Write out the compressed block bodies (the ones deflate_chunk returns)
#   to your output, in sequence
# * Write out the footer (\03\00)
#
# The resulting stream is guaranteed to be handled properly by all zip
# unarchiving tools, including the BOMArchiveHelper/ArchiveUtility on OSX.
#
# You could also build a compressor for Rubyzip using this module quite easily,
# even though this is outside the scope of the library.
#
# When you deflate the chunks separately, you need to write the end marker
# yourself (using `write_terminator`).
# If you just want to deflate a large IO's contents, use
# `deflate_in_blocks_and_terminate` to have the end marker written out for you.
#
# Basic usage to compress a file in parts:
#
#     source_file = File.open('12_gigs.bin', 'rb')
#     compressed = Tempfile.new
#     # Will not compress everything in memory, but do it per chunk to spare
#       memory. `compressed`
#     # will be written to at the end of each chunk.
#     ZipTricks::BlockDeflate.deflate_in_blocks_and_terminate(source_file,
#                                                             compressed)
#
# You can also do the same to parts that you will later concatenate together
# elsewhere, in that case you need to skip the end marker:
#
#     compressed = Tempfile.new
#     ZipTricks::BlockDeflate.deflate_in_blocks(File.open('part1.bin', 'rb),
#                                               compressed)
#     ZipTricks::BlockDeflate.deflate_in_blocks(File.open('part2.bin', 'rb),
#                                               compressed)
#     ZipTricks::BlockDeflate.deflate_in_blocks(File.open('partN.bin', 'rb),
#                                               compressed)
#     ZipTricks::BlockDeflate.write_terminator(compressed)
#
# You can also elect to just compress strings in memory (to splice them later):
#
#     compressed_string = ZipTricks::BlockDeflate.deflate_chunk(big_string)
