require 'set'

# Is used to write streamed ZIP archives into the provided IO-ish object.
# The output IO is never going to be rewound or seeked, so the output
# of this object can be coupled directly to, say, a Rack output.
#
# Allows for splicing raw files (for "stored" entries without compression)
# and splicing of deflated files (for "deflated" storage mode).
#
# For stored entries, you need to know the CRC32 (as a uint) and the filesize upfront,
# before the writing of the entry body starts.
#
# Any object that responds to `<<` can be used as the Streamer target - you can use
# a String, an Array, a Socket or a File, at your leisure.
#
# ## Using the Streamer with runtime compression
#
# You can use the Streamer with data descriptors (the CRC32 and the sizes will be
# written after the file data). This allows non-rewinding on-the-fly compression.
# If you are compressing large files, the Deflater object that the Streamer controls
# will be regularly flushed to prevent memory inflation.
#
#     ZipTricks::Streamer.open(file_socket_or_string) do |zip|
#       zip.write_stored_file('mov.mp4') do |sink|
#         File.open('mov.mp4', 'rb'){|source| IO.copy_stream(source, sink) }
#       end
#       zip.write_deflated_file('long-novel.txt') do |sink|
#         File.open('novel.txt', 'rb'){|source| IO.copy_stream(source, sink) }
#       end
#     end
#
# The central directory will be written automatically at the end of the block.
#
# ## Using the Streamer with entries of known size and having a known CRC32 checksum
#
# Streamer allows "IO splicing" - in this mode it will only control the metadata output,
# but you can write the data to the socket/file outside of the Streamer. For example, when
# using the sendfile gem:
#
#     ZipTricks::Streamer.open(socket) do | zip |
#       zip.add_stored_entry(filename: "myfile1.bin", size: 9090821, crc32: 12485)
#       socket.sendfile(tempfile1)
#       zip.simulate_write(tempfile1.size)
#
#       zip.add_stored_entry(filename: "myfile2.bin", size: 458678, crc32: 89568)
#       socket.sendfile(tempfile2)
#       zip.simulate_write(tempfile2.size)
#     end
#
# Note that you need to use `simulate_write` in this case. This needs to happen since Streamer
# writes absolute offsets into the ZIP (local file header offsets and the like),
# and it relies on the output object to tell it how many bytes have been written
# so far. When using `sendfile` the Ruby write methods get bypassed entirely, and the
# offsets in the IO will not be updated - which will result in an invalid ZIP.
#
# The central directory will be written automatically at the end of the `open` block.
